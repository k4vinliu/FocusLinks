# URL-Saver-Chrome-Extension
A simple Chrome Extension allowing users to save and delete links with just one click!

Chrome extension I created using JavaScript, HTML/CSS, chrome.tabs api, and more.

Keyboard shortkeys for different operating systems:
Windows: Ctrl+Shift+Y
Mac: Command+Shift+Y
Chromeos: Ctrl+Shift+U
Linux: Ctrl+Shift+J

There are three functionailities on this chrome extension:
1. Save Tab: Saves the URL of the current active tab the user is on while giving it a custom name (title)
2. View links: View all links/titles saved
3. Delete: Delete a specific link/title that was saved
